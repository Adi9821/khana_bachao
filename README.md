# Topic Name : Nitya_Taza
# What’s the Problem?
Every year, tons of food gets wasted due to poor tracking and unawareness of expiry timelines. Our solution empowers users to track and manage their food inventory smartly — reducing waste, saving money, and promoting sustainability.


# Why This Project?
We wanted to build something useful, simple, and scalable. This app can help households, restaurants, or even small grocery shops avoid throwing away good food just because it was forgotten.


# What’s Unique About It?
our app considers real-world factors — temperature, humidity, and packaging — to intelligently predict expiry. With a user-friendly UI and a scalable backend, it’s built for daily use and real-world impact.
